## Hi there 👋

My name is Pitta, an explorer in progress! 

Fairy Pitta (Pitta nympha) is a small passerine bird in the family Pittidae. 

I'm interested in the database architecture!\
I'm currently learning react (js) and sql. 

You can find my [Qitta](https://qiita.com/Pitta) , I post my competitive programming stuff from time to time along with my daily struggles (in Japanese though).
